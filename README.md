Capstone Project for module 2 Data Analysis for NYC TLC Trip Record

Background

This data is an official record of *Green Taxi (Street Hail Livery)* trips provided by the *New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)*. Green Taxis primarily operate in the outer boroughs of NYC (like Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx) and Upper Manhattan. The dataset captures every aspect of a trip, from the moment a passenger is picked up to the final payment, including geographical locations, trip length, time, and a detailed breakdown of the fare. The primary business concern is optimizing service delivery and balancing profit margins in these specific, high-growth outer borough markets.

Problem Statement

**The New York City Green Taxi** service needs to improve revenue per trip and optimize fleet deployment by better understanding dynamic passenger demand, trip performance and cost in the outer boroughs.

1. Demand & Efficiency	: What are the peak hours and days of the week for pickups, the average trip duration and which TLC zones (PULocationID) drive the highest trip volume?

2. Trip Performance	: What is the average speed performance of Standard TAXI vs JFK TAXI/Newark? And how is their performance during each trip?

3. Revenue & Cost	    : How much driver actually get additional tips/percentage tips from each trip? and how much the average cost per miles that each trip has?
